tup = "hello"
print(len(tup))
# tup is defined as the sting "hello" print(len(tup)) is printing how many characters are in the string. i.e hello = 5
# characters.

tup = "hello",
print(len(tup))
# the itroduction of a comma after the string makes the print function count the amount of strings there are

tup = "hello", "goodbye"
print(len(tup))
# by putting a second string separated by a comma results in the number 2 being printed.
